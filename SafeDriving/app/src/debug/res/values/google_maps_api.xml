    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    A7:E5:47:51:F2:C1:B8:6A:F0:D3:13:B7:CF:47:FF:B1:02:0F:44:D9;com.imperium.autobeacon

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
